    <h2>Why Eclipse?</h2>
</div>

- It's really easy to download & use.
- It's fully open source, not a suspicious EXE you have to trust.
- There's no "paid version" or requirement - it's free!
- It's user friendly & fast.

<h2 align="center">Installation</h2>

1. Install the Current [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) version.
2. Open your Terminal or Powershell and enter `git clone https://github.com/VillainsRule/Discord-Nuker && cd Discord-Nuker`.
    - If it says 'git' is not known or some other similar error, [download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and try again.
3. Run `npm i && node.` to install our dependencies and run.

<br>
It's that simple!<br>
Enjoy nuking :v<br>
