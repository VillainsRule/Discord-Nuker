    <h1>Eclipse Nuker</h1>
    <h3>an advanced discord server nuker, complete with a cool terminal UI.</h3>
    <h5>for educational purposes, ofc</h5>
    <br>
    <h2>Why Eclipse?</h2>
</div>

- The tool has advanced & user-friendly guides on running the tool - it's easy!
- Everything is open source, not a suspicious .exe or .pkg you need to trust.
- There's no "paid version" or requirement - it's fully free!
- The interface is simple & function-focused.
- The tool is (mostly) quick.
- The tool supports both bots & selfbots.
- The tool is regularly updated & patched!

<h2 align="center">Installation</h2>

1. Install the Current [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) version.
2. Open your Terminal or Powershell and enter `git clone https://github.com/VillainsRule/Discord-Nuker && cd Discord-Nuker`.
    - If it says 'git' is not known or some other similar error, [download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and try again.
3. Run `npm i && node.` to install our dependencies and start nuking!

It's that simple!<br>

To run the tool again later, just run this command in the terminal: `cd Discord-Nuker && node .`

<br>
<h2 align="center">Configuration</h2>

When you boot the program, you'll be asked a few questions.<br>
To make startup faster each time, set these in config.txt.<br>
I'm not gonna explain how config.txt works, because it's obvious.

<br>
Enjoy nuking :v<br>
